Turn your beloved old typewriter into a modern computer keyboard with a few extra bells and whistles.

We like typewriters and hope you do too! Thatâ€™s why we started Typebar, an open-source project designed to allow the quick and easy re-purposing of vintage typewriters to be used as modern computer typing interfaces (keyboards and alike).
